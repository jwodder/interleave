The ``interleave`` package provides a function of the same name that takes a
number of iterators, runs them in separate threads, and yields the values
produced as soon as each one is available.  It is currently a work in progress.

Installation
============
``interleave`` requires Python 3.7 or higher.  Just use `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install
``interleave`` and its dependencies::

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/jwodder/interleave.git
